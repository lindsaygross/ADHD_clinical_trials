Data represent the post-treatment minus baseline change in BOLD contrast Aggressive Response\> Monetary Response.; BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) fMRI contrast (neural activation) investigates brain activity by measuring the change in blood oxygenation. It was collected during the PSAP behavioral task while playing the game: the participants play a computer game in which they can steal points (simulating an aggressive behavior) or have points stolen by the opponent (provocation event) by pressing Option 1, 2 or 3 on a keypad a set number of times to achieve a specific outcome. A positive number represents an increase in activity. The region of interest is described by the location of the peak value within that cluster and described by Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) X, Y, and Z coordinates. Data represent the post-treatment minus baseline change in BOLD contrast Provocation Event \>Monetary Response.; The Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP) is a behavioral aggression paradigm consisting of a computer game in which each participant plays against a computer to earn points. The subject can steal points (i.e., aggressive behavior) or have points stolen by the opponent (i.e., provocation). The subject can press 1 of 3 buttons on a keypad a set number of times. By pressing the button for Option 1, 100 times, the subject will earn a point; pressing the button for Option 2, 20 consecutive times is the ""aggression"" action that results in stealing a point from the opponent; pressing Option 3, 20 times protects the subject from the opponent's attempt to steal points (i.e., money). The aggression score is averaged across two sessions and calculated as the number of Option 2 button presses divided by the sum of total button presses and the number of provocation events received, with a range minimum = 1, maximum = 143. The higher scores reflect increased aggression.",Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Impulsive Aggression,United States,8 Years,12 Years,ALL,False

Lidocaine effectiveness was quantitated as the reduction or elimination of taste by lidocaine compared to taste scores reported before lidocaine. For each of the four before/after pairs, the change in taste intensity was calculated, a weighted average score was computed. Incorrectly identified tastes were excluded. Scores of a reduction in taste ≥50% were considered to be lidocaine effective.",ADHD; PMS,United States,18 Years,49 Years,ALL,True
